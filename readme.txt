=== Description ===

Admin Bar Tools gives you access to useful tools for running WordPress.

## What is Admin Bar Tools?
This plugin allows you to add useful links to the admin bar.
In order to check PageSpeed ​​Insights, Twitter search, and Google index, you had to open each site and copy and paste the URL to confirm it until now.
But Admin Bar Tools allows you to do it in just one click.
This is very innovative.

You can access each tool from individual pages, articles, and management screens, which eliminates the troublesome operations.
We're glad that you can concentrate on writing.
